# smallsh
`smallsh` is a lightweight shell for Linux, built from scratch as the final project for Justin Goins' Operating Systems I class at Oregon State University, winter 2020. I have since expanded it with several features beyond its required functionality as a class project.

# features
 * tab completion and line editing by the GNU readline library
 * I/O redirection of stdin and stdout
 * Running processes in the background
 * Localized information/error messages by the GNU gettext library

# compiling
 * Run `make` in the directory containing Makefile and main.c
